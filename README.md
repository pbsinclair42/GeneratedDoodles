# GeneratedDoodles
A wee project I made which randomly generates mathematical artwork.  For example:

![Density 50](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbsinclair42/GeneratedDoodles/master/Examples/Density50%20eg1.PNG)

The artwork is generated based on two parameters: size and density.  The example above uses density 50, the recommended setting, but other pretty artwork can be generated at alternative settings.  For example, the artwork below uses density 0 and is, in a slightly different way, also very nice.  

![Density 0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbsinclair42/GeneratedDoodles/master/Examples/Density0%20eg3.PNG)

More examples of a variety of densities can be found in the 'Examples' folder.
